# twitter-bot

This is my little twitter bot

## Features

### Interactive authorization 
It will ask for consumer keys (get them at https://apps.twitter.com by creating an app).  
Then it will prompt you to autorize your app using OAuth.  
All tokens will be saved for future use an script won't prompt you for authorization again.  
Configure where to save tokens by modifying `twitter-bot.ini`.
